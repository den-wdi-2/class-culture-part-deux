# Classroom Culture and Project Week

## Emotional Framing
- Programming is not about learning a sequence of steps, it's about developing a mindset to solve problems and think programmatically.
- Language not important
    - critical/analytical/programatic thinking.
    - don't memorize, conceptualize ideas.
        - the internet is your notebook/memory
    - be able to adapt quickly
- Deal with chaos in your head. Being confused/lost is NORMAL. No one pays you because you know all the answers. The job is about jumping into confusion and being able to find a solution.
- Development can be very personal
	- Debugging your own mistakes
	- Being a good "Googler" and reading tech documents takes practice
	- You learn more by doing than by listening
	- We try not to hold your hand
		- There is a decent amount of failure that happens initially
			- good to get that out of the way before starting work
- The maximum point of learning is right at the edge of learning and panic.

## You Are Not Your Code!

## Classroom Culture
- Open safe environment
- Take ownership of your experience
- Check your ego at the door
- Empathy
- Don't compare yourself to others, compare yourself to who you were yesterday
- You get what you put in

## Mentorship Culture
- Take care of each other
- Benchmarking; some are good at one thing, others at another. Leverage each other's strengths.
- Teaching is the best way of truly solidifying your understanding of a concept.
- Your classmates will be the best foundation for establishing a professional network in tech!

## Common Student Worries
1. I'm making a lot of mistakes
1. Imposter syndrome
1. I don't "do" math
1. What's the best practice? Finding the one "correct" answer
	- Best practices change constantly and from company to company
	- If you think properly, you'll probably naturally arrive at a best practice
	- All that matters is "Does it work?"
		- A company that hires someone with 3 months of experience doesn't really care about code quality
		- Use your time to learn new technology or strengthen your problem solving
1. Having a perfect understanding of everything
	- Class is set up to accommodate students of all abilities
		- Scaffolded lecture notes, homework, and projects
	- We make sure you understand at least the most important concepts
1. Having an amazing portfolio/completing all assignments
	- all projects suck
		- what matters is the ability to think
	- don't worry about completing every lab/homework
		- they're there as an exercise in thinking
		- completing and sleeping for 2 hours is worse than sleeping and not completing
1. Asking the instructional team questions
	- For lecture and labs, ask questions constantly
	- For Homework, queue up with the evening TA
		- This will force you to do some debugging on your own, but it will also give you a quick resource if you're stuck
	- Projects is your time to see what the real world will be like
		- the more time you spend fixing, the more you learn
		- receiving an answer stops the learning process

## Setting you up for success

Read through the following.  Write down / type your five major takeaways.

- Check your homework by figuring out ways to test your answers to see if they are correct.  Don't wait for feedback.
	- You should be able to answer the question "did I do it right?" on your own.
	- In the real world, you'll need to figure out how to test your code to see if it works.  You won't have someone to read your code and tell you if you did it right.
	- There is no "best" solution.  Ultimately, the only thing that matters is, "does it work?"
	- Code "quality" (how you write code) doesn't matter too much as a jr developer.  Only your ability to solve problems matters
- Try to create a relationship with all other students. You don't know when you'll need a second set of eyes. Sometimes bugs are really stupid, and can be spotted by anyone.  It's like writing an essay where your eyes know what you're trying to say and don't see mistakes
- growth mindset vs fixed mindset
	- growth mindset
		- people who believe that ability can be learned are highly successful
	- fixed mindset
		- people who believe that ability is something you're born with are not successful
	- focus on the learning process, not on the results of your current task
		- you'll succeed more and have more fun
	- different types of fixed mindsets.  Monitor your reactions for these feelings:
		- You’re Wrong I Rule: person is unable to accept that they did something wrong
		- You’re Right I Suck: any criticism immediately sends person into feeling like they're worthless
		- Blame it On The Rain: any mistake a person makes is explained away by circumstance.  The person believes this won't happen again, so there's no need to correct
		- Optimist Without a Cause: criticism is not important, given everything else that went well
- Programming is like writing an essay in a language you don't know.  Know what you want to say and then research how to say it
	- come up with the solution to a problem on your own and then research any syntax you might need in order to implement it.  Do not research the answer to the problem itself
- Help out everyone.
- Plagiarism (passing someone else's solution off as your own) will only result in you getting job that you're unqualified for and will get fired from
	- Your employers will quickly discover that you don't know what you say you know
	- If you feel you can't complete the work, come to your instructors and we can figure out a way for you to turn in something meaningful.  There is always a solution.
- Project weeks
	- community bonding time.  Help each other out
	- a chance to simulate the real world and see where you need improvement
		- this is where you'll get a lot of practice with researching and debugging
- Bringing up your mistakes during class often illuminates good points to talk about
	- it's very difficult as an instructor to come up with scenarios where a student will make a mistake, since everyone makes different kinds of mistakes
- Don't compare yourself with other students. This is not school, where everyone comes in with roughly equivalent experience
	- There is plenty of work available for graduates at all levels, as long as you fully understand the work you present to employers
- Don't let problems/questions of any kind (programming or personal) fester. Bring them up immediately to an instructor.
  - DM instructors for personal problems/questions
  - GH issue in class slack channel for programming problems/questions
- We only "open the doors" you have to walk through the door.  We guide you, but you'll have to do most of the work.
- Learning how to debug your own code and read documentation/articles/forums takes practice.  This is not really something that can be taught.  Make sure you struggle and read a lot on the internet on your own time.  Don't immediately ask for help
- Learn what kind of mistakes you make
- Type things out, don't copy and paste.  Copy and pasting takes your mind off of what you're doing.
- There is a disconnect between knowing something at a conceptual level and being able to use it.  Make sure you can do both
	- Just because you can look at code and understand it, it doesn't mean you can build something like it
- We create increasing levels of independence: lecture (very hands on) -> lab -> homework -> project (very hands off)
	- This is to ease you into what it will be like in real life
- Your community of students is the best aspect of GA. They will help you with finding work and help you when you are stuck on a problem at work
